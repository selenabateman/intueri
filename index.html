  <h2>Therapeutic Support &amp; Scope of Support</h2>

  <p>
    At Intueri Wellness, counseling is not about re-living what happened.
  </p>

  <p>
    We focus on understanding the impact of abuse.<br>
    We prioritize safety and stability.<br>
    We develop the skills needed to move forward with clarity and confidence.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Your past doesn’t get to define your future.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Support is trauma-informed and stabilization-oriented following intimate partner
    violence, coercive control, and post-separation harm.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our work is structured, practical, and evidence-based.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therapeutic interventions draw on the <em>When Love Hurts</em> curriculum,
    Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT),
   and psychosomatic interventions.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Our work together includes:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Understanding patterns of coercive control and abuse dynamics</li>
    <li>Identifying and reducing trauma-driven emotional and cognitive responses</li>
    <li>Reducing shame, self-blame, and internalized responsibility</li>
    <li>Building emotional regulation and distress-tolerance skills</li>
    <li>Supporting self-trust, agency, and forward momentum</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The work emphasizes restoring agency, supporting decision-making capacity,
    and reducing the ongoing impacts of coercive control over time.
